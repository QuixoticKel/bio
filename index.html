      <h2 class="profile-h2">Hello</h2>
      <div class="profile-paragraph">
        <p> I'm a highly-technical, intentionally-curious analytics and operations leader. I'm a self-described skeptic, working to prove myself wrong (see: scientific method) in order to ultimately discover the best-as-we-know-it truth.
        </p>
        <p> I love traveling, reading, and learning about that new gadget or tech that just hit the market. In my off time, you'll find me in the shop building something, learning how to model in 3D to better
          use my 3D printer and laser cutter or learning a new language (computer or spoken) to enhance and improve my life and how I can better interact with those around me.

        <img class="skill-images-left" src="images/DataViz2.gif" alt="">
        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>I was a natural convert to analytics after years as a data-driven sales leader. Before jumping into analytics as a sole discipline, I honed my technical chops as a Senior Salesforce Admin/Marketing Operations manager. Now, as a Senior
          Analytics Manager I run and am responsible for the reporting and analytics for a
          300+ B2B SDR program at T-Mobile. This full-scope work includes in-depth, ad-hoc analysis; building always-on, automated reports with PowerBI and other tools; and answering critical questions or providing insights for the executive team to
          make important business decisions. </p>
      </div>

        <img class="skill-images-right" src="images/MarkOps.gif" alt="">
        <h3>Operations</h3>
        <p> Having built a Salesforce instance from the ground up for a performance marketing agency, I'm able to provide not only answers to questions that the business may have, but also how the system
          or process can be updated to improve performance and close any gaps.
          I also have the ability to communicate these recommendations to both the business stakeholders and the Salesforce Admins with exactly what needs to happen within the system to solve issues and improve any reporting or process gaps that
          exist. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="skill-images-left" src="images/Salesforce.gif" alt="">
        <h3>Automation</h3>
        <p>Gratefully unsatisfied I always seek out novel and automated solutions to manual processes. Along these lines I've learned SQL, R, and Python to assist with both my data gathering and
          analytics. A perpetual learner, I've also pushed myself to learn the full data-analytics stack, including Azure's Data Factory. To continue this always-on learning, I maintain my own Azure instance where I can experiment with new tech, connections and processes as I learn and
          discover them. </p>
